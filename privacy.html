            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The short version</h2>
                <p>Your thoughts stay on your device. We don't collect them, we don't see them, we don't sell them.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Data we collect</h2>
                <p><strong>None.</strong></p>
                <p>Spillover does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your captured thoughts are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and never leave your phone.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>No account required</h2>
                <p>Spillover does not require you to create an account. There's no sign-up, no email collection, no user profiles.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>No cloud sync</h2>
                <p>Your data is not synced to any cloud service. It exists only on your device. If you delete the app, your data is deleted with it.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>No analytics</h2>
                <p>We do not use analytics tools to track how you use the app. We don't know how often you open it, what you type, or when you use it.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Permissions we request</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Screen Time</strong> — Required to block apps during quiet hours. This uses Apple's Family Controls framework.</li>
                    <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — Optional. Used to remind you to review your captured thoughts in the morning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reminders</strong> — Optional. Allows you to add captured thoughts directly to Apple Reminders.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These permissions are processed entirely on-device by Apple's frameworks. No data is sent to us.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Third-party services</h2>
                <p>Spillover does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or analytics platforms.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Data deletion</h2>
                <p>Delete the app to delete all your data. You can also delete individual thoughts from within the app at any time.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
                <p>If we ever change this policy, we'll update the date at the top of this page. But our commitment is simple: your data stays yours.</p>
